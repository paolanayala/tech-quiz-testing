# tech-quiz-test-suite
Module 19

This project is an enhanced version of a fully functional MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) Tech Quiz application. To ensure the application's reliability and robustness, Cypress has been integrated for both component and end-to-end (E2E) testing. Key features include initiating the quiz, navigating through questions, viewing scores, and restarting the quiz.

The primary motivation behind adding Cypress testing was to strengthen the Tech Quiz appâ€™s foundation by verifying that each user interaction performs as intended. By adding Cypress testing, the project aims to detect and prevent bugs, ensure seamless user interactions, and maintain high standards of performance and reliability.

**Key Features**
**Cypress Configuration**: Set up Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing within the MERN stack environment.
**Component Testing**: Developed a component test for the quiz component to verify its individual functionality, such as rendering questions and handling user inputs.
**End-to-End Testing**: Created comprehensive E2E tests that simulate real user interactions, ensuring the entire quiz flow works as expected. This includes starting the quiz, answering questions, and completing the quiz.

**Installation**
Clone the repository, install the dependencies, add and configure environmental variables, start the dev server, run cypress tests. 

**What I Learned**
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with integrating Cypress into a MERN stack application, writing effective component and end-to-end tests, and enhancing application reliability through automated testing.
